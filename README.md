 Then next comes different sections each of these section has headings.I have used typing javascript below my name.The project section has github project link and the  links for contact section.
 ### Problems Faced
navigation bar was not working as in it use to cover the whole page I made the hieght of the header 
As this was my first github project ,I faced alot of issues while configuration.
Animation part took maximum time.To make the webpage responsive was fatiguing.
